## How to deploy on Replit

Step 1. Create a **NEW** Repl.

Step 2. Scroll down and select **Node.js** as the template.

Step 3. Name the Repl, and then click **"Create Repl"**.

Step 4. On the right-hand side of the screen, you should see a panel labeled "Shell". Copy and paste the following code into the Shell:

`
git clone https://github.com/interstellarnetwork/interstellar-deployable.git
`

Once the deployment is complete, you will see a folder called **"interstellar-deployable"**. You need to move all the files that are inside the folder out of that folder.
